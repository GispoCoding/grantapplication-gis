How to collect and analyze data from grant applications - QGIS project & mockups

The QGIS project consists of various made up point datasets to allow us to make analyses and mockups of the data.

Different analysis consist of:

The amount of money granted for different areas
Calculate the sum of grants given for certain postal code areas. Then divide the total with grants given for certain forms of art to visualize how the money was divided between artforms.

Hexagon analysis:
create a hexagon grid + count points in polygon

Calculate the amount of granted applications within a population square
